## Setting up your machine

### Step 1: Install Python

- Python often comes preinstalled on macOS, but it's usually a slightly older version. To install the latest version, I recommend using Homebrew. Open Terminal and type:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

- Then install Python:

```bash
brew install python
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

- You can verify the Python installation by checking the version. In Terminal, type:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### Step 3: Install a Text Editor

- Next, you'll need a text editor to write your code. You can use any editor you're comfortable with, but Visual Studio Code is a popular choice.

- Download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

### Step 4: Setup Your Workspace

- Create a new folder anywhere you'd like for your Python work. You can do this through Finder or by using the `mkdir` command in Terminal.

### Step 5: Write Your First Program

- Open VS Code and create a new file with the `.py` extension. For example, `hello_world.py`.

- Write the following code:

```python
print("Hello, Python!")
```

- Save and run the code by opening Terminal, navigating to your Python work folder with the `cd` command, and then running the file:

```bash
python3 hello_world.py
```

## Python Basics

Here are some fundamental concepts you'll need to start programming in Python.

1. **Variables and Types**

   In Python, you can create a variable and assign a value to it with the `=` sign. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create it.
   
   ```python
   x = 10  # integer
   y = 20.5  # float
   z = "Hello"  # string
   ```

2. **Basic Operators**

   You can use basic mathematical operators with Python numbers. Here are the addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`) operators:
   
   ```python
   a = 10
   b = 20
   print(a + b)  # Outputs: 30
   ```

3. **Strings**

   You can define strings using either single quotes `'` or double quotes `"`. To concatenate two strings, use the `+` operator:
   
   ```python
   str1 = "Hello"
   str2 = "World"
   print(str1 + " " + str2)  # Outputs: Hello World
   ```

4. **Lists**

   A list is a collection of items. You can create a list by putting comma-separated values inside square brackets `[]`. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their data anytime.
   
   ```python
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   print(fruits[0])  # Outputs: apple
   ```

5. **Dictionaries**

   A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces `{}`. A colon (`:`) separates each key from its associated value:
   
   ```python
   person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
   print(person["name"])  # Outputs: John
   ```

6. **Control Flow**

   Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`. These can be used in several control structures like `if`, `if..else`, `if..elif..else` and loops like `while`, `for`.

7. **Functions**

   Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword. For example:
   
   ```python
   def greet(name):
       print("Hello, " + name)

   greet("Python learner")  # Outputs: Hello, Python learner
   ```

8. **Importing Modules**

   You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an `import` statement in some other Python source file. Python's standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of modules for various tasks.

   ```python
   import math
   print(math.pi)  # Outputs: 3.141592653589793
   ```

9. **Error Handling**

   Python uses `try` and `except` blocks to handle exceptions. Code in the `try` block is executed statement by statement. If an error occurs, the rest of the `try` block is skipped and the `except` block is executed.

   ```python
   try:
       print(10 / 0)
   except ZeroDivisionError:
       print("Cannot divide by zero.")
   ```

10. **Working with APIs**

    For working with APIs, you'll mostly use the `requests` module in Python. It's not part of the standard library, so you'll need to install it with pip:

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
   
    Here's a simple example of a GET request:

    ```python
    import requests
    response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
    ```

These are just the basics. Python has many more features like classes (for object-oriented programming), decorators, generators, etc. But this should be a good starting point. Start practicing these concepts, and we can move on to more advanced topics as you get comfortable.

## Prompt

```I would like to move from basics nowExplain python rules and capabilities on more complex level.
For example:
- what are the possibilities of sugar syntaxing
- does python supports lamba functions
- is it possible to pass function as an argument to another function
- what kind of operators exists. I am thinking about map, reduce, filter etc

Do not limit yourself on the examples provided above. It was just a guidance to you. I expect much broader explanation.
```

### 1. Python Syntactic Sugar

Python includes several examples of syntactic sugar that make it more readable and easier to write:

- List Comprehensions: They provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists.

    ```python
    # Square of each item in a list
    squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
    ```

- Generator Expressions: They are similar to list comprehensions but they return a generator rather than a list, which can be more memory efficient.

    ```python
    # Sum of squares
    sum_of_squares = sum(x**2 for x in range(10))
    ```

- Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator): They provide a way to condense simple `if-else` statements into a single line.

    ```python
    # Conditional assignment
    x = 10
    value = "Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
    ```

### 2. Lambda Functions

Python supports the use of anonymous (lambda) functions, which are small, one-line functions. For example:

```python
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y
print(multiply(5, 6))  # Output: 30
```

### 3. Higher-Order Functions

Python allows for functions to be used as first-class objects, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions. Functions that take other functions as arguments are called higher-order functions. 

```python
def apply_func(x, y, func):
    return func(x, y)

sum_result = apply_func(5, 7, lambda x, y: x + y)
print(sum_result)  # Output: 12
```

### 4. Map, Filter, Reduce, and More

Python includes several built-in functions that work well with lists:

- `map()`: Applies a function to all items in an input list.

- `filter()`: Creates a list of elements for which a function returns true.

- `reduce()`: A function from `functools` that applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence, from left to right.

Python also has more powerful libraries like `itertools` and `functools` that provide additional functionality.

### 5. Decorators

Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function call")
        func()
        print("After function call")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

### 6. Context Managers

Context managers allow you to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to. The most widely used example of context managers is the `with` statement.

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    print(file.read())
```

### 7. Generators and Coroutines

Python generators are a simple way of creating iterators. It involves a function with a `yield` statement instead of a return statement.

```python
def simple_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

for num in simple_generator():
    print(num)
```

Coroutines are generalization of subroutines. They are used for cooperative multitasking where a process voluntarily yield (give away) control periodically or when idle in order to enable multiple applications to be run simultaneously.

### 8. AsyncIO

Python 3.7 introduced the asyncio module, which is a library to write single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitives. The asyncio module provides a framework that revolves around the event loop, an asynchronous programming model.

These are some of the many advanced topics in Python. If you're interested in going deeper into any specific area, please let me know!

##Prompt

```
explain decorators in python.

What is it?
When it is useful in practice?
Explain every argument that is passed and it's value in execution.
Write down the output of the function calls (assume values for the sake of example).
```

## 1. What is a Decorator in Python?

In Python, decorators are essentially functions that add functionality to an existing function without changing its structure. They achieve this by taking a function as an argument, wrapping it in another function (the decorator) that can execute code before or after the wrapped function runs, and then returning that wrapping function. 

## 2. When are Decorators Useful in Practice?

Decorators can be used when you want to add the same piece of code or behavior to multiple functions. This way, you don't need to add the same code block to every function. 

Examples include:

- Logging: Decorators can be used to log function calls, showing function name and arguments.

- Timing: They can be used to compute how much time a function takes to execute.

- Memoization: They can be used to store function call results so the function doesn't need to be called again for the same arguments.

- Authorization: Decorators can check whether a user is authorized to execute a function.

## 3. Explanation of Arguments Passed

Here's a typical structure of a decorator function:

```python
def decorator_func(original_func):
    def wrapper_func(*args, **kwargs):
        # Code executed before the original function
        original_func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Code executed after the original function
    return wrapper_func
```

The decorator function (`decorator_func`) accepts the original function as its argument. 

The wrapping function (`wrapper_func`) accepts any number of positional (`*args`) and keyword (`**kwargs`) arguments. These arguments are passed to the original function when it is called.

## 4. Example of a Decorator

Let's look at a simple logging decorator that logs the start and end of a function call:

```python
def logging_decorator(func):
    def wrapper_func(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Started {func.__name__}({args}, {kwargs})")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Finished {func.__name__}({args}, {kwargs}), returned: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper_func

@logging_decorator
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

add(3, 5)
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
Started add((3, 5), {})
Finished add((3, 5), {}), returned: 8
```

The `add` function is called with arguments 3 and 5. The decorator logs the start and end of the function call, including the arguments and the return value.

## Prompt
```
what does * in *args and **kwargs define? 
```

## Response
In Python, `*args` and `**kwargs` are special syntax used in function definitions to allow for variable numbers of arguments.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. `*args`: The `*` operator is used in function definitions to collect all the positional arguments that are not explicitly defined into a tuple. This allows you to pass an arbitrary number of positional arguments to your function. 

For example:

```python
def func(*args):
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)

func(1, 2, 3, 4)  # Output: 1 2 3 4
```

2. `**kwargs`: Similarly, the `**` operator is used to collect all the keyword arguments that are not explicitly defined into a dictionary. This allows you to pass an arbitrary number of keyword arguments to your function.

For example:

```python
def func(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

func(first='a', second='b', third='c')  # Output: first: a second: b third: c
```

The names `args` and `kwargs` are just conventions, you could name them differently, but it's recommended to stick with these names for consistency and readability.

```
Is it possible to inject additional arguments into *args when defining a decorator
```

Yes, you can inject additional arguments in a decorator, but it changes the way the decorator is defined and used slightly. Instead of just using the decorator name with the @ symbol, you will also need to add parentheses (even if you're not passing any additional arguments).

Here's an example of a decorator that takes additional arguments:

```python
def my_decorator(arg1, arg2):
    def actual_decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Decorator arguments: {arg1}, {arg2}")
            func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return actual_decorator

@my_decorator("hello", "world")
def my_function(x, y):
    print(f"Function arguments: {x}, {y}")

my_function("python", "rocks")
```

In this example, `my_decorator` takes two arguments and returns the actual decorator, `actual_decorator`. Then `my_function` is decorated with `actual_decorator("hello", "world")`.

When you run `my_function("python", "rocks")`, you will get:

```
Decorator arguments: hello, world
Function arguments: python, rocks
```

This shows that the decorator was able to take its own arguments ("hello", "world") and the decorated function was able to take its own arguments ("python", "rocks").

## Prompt
```
I wanna create a decorator called Authorize, with argument called "role".

Purpose of this decorator is to check the role of the user running a specific function. 
If it's admin or moderator role, it can run the function.
if it's user role, it cannot run the function.
Assume that the user role is read from the database.
Assume that the userId exists in some session object that is globally accessible

Write an example of this use case.
```
## Solution
Firstly, let's simulate a globally accessible session object:

```python
# This is a simulation of a globally accessible session object
# In a real-world scenario, this could be a session object in a web framework like Flask or Django
session = {
    'userId': 1
}
```

Next, modify the `get_role_from_db` function to fetch the `userId` from the session object:

```python
def get_role_from_db():
    user_id = session['userId']
    # Replace this line with actual database query logic
    # For now, assuming every user_id greater than 1 is 'admin' or 'moderator' and 1 is 'user'
    return 'admin' if user_id > 1 else 'user'
```

Lastly, modify the `wrapper` function inside the decorator to not require `userId` as a parameter:

```python
def authorize(role):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            user_role = get_role_from_db()
            if user_role in role:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            else:
                print(f"User is not authorized.")
                return None
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

Now, your `sensitive_function` can be defined without needing the `userId` as a parameter:

```python
@authorize(['admin', 'moderator'])
def sensitive_function(data):
    print(f"Executing sensitive function with data {data}")
```

You can test it by changing the `userId` in the session and calling the `sensitive_function`:

```python
session['userId'] = 1
sensitive_function("Some data")  # Output: User is not authorized.

session['userId'] = 2
sensitive_function("Some data")  # Output: Executing sensitive function with data Some data
```

Please note that how you access the session or global object may vary based on the framework or environment you're working in.

## Prompt

```
What is "None" in the example above?
```

## Response
In Python, `None` is a special constant that represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is an object of its own datatype, the `NoneType`. We can assign `None` to any variable, but you can not create other `NoneType` objects.

In the provided examples, `None` is being used as a return value in the cases where the function is not being executed. This is a common practice used to denote that a function didn't return anything meaningful. 

It's similar to returning null in other languages, and it can be helpful for error checking. For instance, after calling the function, you can check if the result is `None` to see if the function was executed successfully or not. 

Here is how you can check it:

```python
result = sensitive_function("Some data")
if result is None:
    print("The function was not executed successfully.")
else:
    print("The function was executed successfully.")
```

## Prompt
```
What are other special constants in Python? 
```

## Response
Python has several special built-in constants. Here are some of the key ones:

1. `None`: As discussed, it represents the absence of a value or a null value.

2. `True` and `False`: These are the two constant objects representing boolean truth values.

3. `__debug__`: This is another constant, that is true if Python is not started with an -O option. 

4. `NotImplemented`: This special value can be returned by binary special methods (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__add__`, `__rsub__`, etc.) to indicate that the operation is not implemented with respect to the other type.

5. `Ellipsis`: This is a special value used mostly in conjunction with Python's slicing syntax. It can also be used in custom code where you need a unique sentinel value.

6. `__name__`: This is a built-in name in Python. When a Python interpreter reads a source file, `__name__` is set to `__main__` if it's running the source file as the main program. If the file is being imported from another script, `__name__` will be set to the file's name.

7. `__file__`: This is a built-in name in Python. It's the pathname of the file from which the module was loaded, if it was loaded from a file.

8. `Exception` classes: Python has a number of built-in exceptions that you can use to handle error conditions. These aren't constants per se, but they do exist in the Python language as built-in names. Examples include `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `IndexError`, `KeyError`, etc.

## Prompt
```
I would like to start learning some practical use cases with python. 
For example, I would like to write python scripts to consume some external API. 

Context:
I am using PyCharm.
I am aware that there are a couple of libraries supporting Rest API consumption. I think that httpx serves the purpose quite well. 

Explain most common concepts when dealing with rest api in python.
Provide examples.
```

Absolutely, Python has a number of excellent libraries for working with APIs. You've mentioned `httpx`, which is indeed a fine choice. Another commonly used library is `requests`.

Before we get started, let's outline the key concepts we'll cover:

- Making HTTP Requests
- Working with JSON
- Handling Errors
- Using Query Parameters

## 1. Making HTTP Requests

HTTP methods (also referred to as verbs) define actions on resources. The most common methods you'll use when consuming a REST API are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.

Example with `httpx`:

```python
import httpx

# Create a client
client = httpx.Client()

# Make a GET request
response = client.get('https://api.github.com/users/octocat')

# Make a POST request
response = client.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data={'key':'value'})
```

## 2. Working with JSON

REST APIs typically return data in JSON format. You can use Python's built-in `json` module to work with JSON data.

```python
# Decode the response to JSON
data = response.json()

# Access data from the response
login = data['login']
```

## 3. Handling Errors

Always ensure to handle potential errors such as a network error or a 4xx/5xx HTTP status code.

```python
if response.status_code == 200:
    print('Success!')
elif response.status_code == 404:
    print('Not Found.')
else:
    print(f'An error occurred. HTTP {response.status_code}')
```

## 4. Using Query Parameters

Query parameters are used to filter or customize the response from the server.

```python
# Make a GET request with query parameters
response = client.get('https://api.github.com/search/repositories', params={'q': 'requests+language:python'})

# Get the JSON data
data = response.json()

# Access data from the response
first_repo_name = data['items'][0]['name']
```

## Prompt
```
provide more advanced example with complex JSON model and proper and practical error handling.
```

Absolutely, you're right. It's often better to use the `with` keyword, which ensures resources are properly cleaned up after use. Here's how we can refactor the previous example to use `httpx` with a context manager:

```python
import httpx
import time

def fetch_github_repos(usernames, sleep_time=2):
    base_url = "https://api.github.com"
    headers = {"Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"}

    for username in usernames:
        try:
            with httpx.Client() as client:
                response = client.get(f"{base_url}/users/{username}/repos", headers=headers)
                response.raise_for_status()

                repos = response.json()

                for repo in repos:
                    print(f"Repo: {repo['name']}")
                    print(f"Description: {repo['description']}")
                    print(f"Stars: {repo['stargazers_count']}")
                    print(f"Forks: {repo['forks_count']}")
                    print("\n---\n")

                # Sleep between requests to avoid hitting rate limit
                time.sleep(sleep_time)

        except httpx.HTTPStatusError as http_err:
            print(f"HTTP error occurred for user {username}: {http_err}")

        except Exception as err:
            print(f"An error occurred for user {username}: {err}")

# Provide list of GitHub usernames
usernames = ["username1", "username2", "username3"]
fetch_github_repos(usernames)
```

The raise_for_status() method is a convenient way to throw an exception if the HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code. We catch these exceptions and print a message. This is a basic demonstration, in real-world applications you might want to retry the request, log the error, or even alert someone.

With the `with` keyword, we create a new client for each username. This automatically closes the client once the operations within the `with` block are done, even if an exception occurs, ensuring that resources are properly managed. This is a good practice to follow, especially when working with resources like network connections or file systems.

## Prompt

```
I like the convenience of "raise_for_status" function. Make a comprehensive list of other helpful functions in context of rest api, with explanations for each of them. 
```

Sure, here's a list of useful methods and properties that are frequently used when working with the `httpx` library and REST APIs:

## 1. HTTP Methods

- `httpx.get(url, params=None, **kwargs)`: Sends a GET request.
- `httpx.post(url, data=None, json=None, **kwargs)`: Sends a POST request.
- `httpx.put(url, data=None, **kwargs)`: Sends a PUT request.
- `httpx.delete(url, **kwargs)`: Sends a DELETE request.
- `httpx.patch(url, data=None, **kwargs)`: Sends a PATCH request.

## 2. Request Information

- `request.url`: Returns the URL of the request.
- `request.method`: Returns the HTTP method of the request.
- `request.headers`: Returns a dictionary-like object containing the request's headers.

## 3. Response Information

- `response.status_code`: Returns the status code from the response.
- `response.headers`: Returns a dictionary-like object containing the response headers.
- `response.text`: Returns the response content as a string.
- `response.content`: Returns the response content in bytes.
- `response.json()`: Decodes the response content as JSON and returns the resulting dictionary.

## 4. Error Handling

- `response.raise_for_status()`: Raises an `httpx.HTTPStatusError` if the HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code.

## 5. Advanced Features

- `httpx.stream(method, url, **kwargs)`: Sends a request and returns an iterable to handle the response in a streaming manner.
- `httpx.Client()`: Returns an instance of the `httpx.Client` class. The client contains its own session pool and supports connection pooling and session configuration.

The above functions will be more than sufficient for most use-cases. For even more advanced usage, I recommend referring to the [httpx documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org/).

Remember, it's important to understand and use the correct HTTP method for the type of operation you are performing as per REST principles: `GET` for retrieving data, `POST` for creating new data, `PUT` for updating existing data, and `DELETE` for deleting data.

## Prompt

```
does httpx support async/await? Provide real world examples if it does.
```

Yes, `httpx` supports asynchronous requests through its `AsyncClient` class. This allows you to make non-blocking HTTP requests.

Below is an example of how to make asynchronous HTTP requests using `httpx`. In this example, we're fetching data from several URLs concurrently:

```python
import httpx
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url)
        return response.json()

async def fetch_all_data(urls):
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results

urls = [
    'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1',
    'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2',
    'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3',
]

# asyncio.run() is the recommended way to run top-level concurrent code
data = asyncio.run(fetch_all_data(urls))
for item in data:
    print(item)
```

Here, `fetch_data` is a coroutine that fetches data from a single URL. `fetch_all_data` creates a task for each URL, then waits for all tasks to complete. 

The `asyncio.run(fetch_all_data(urls))` call at the bottom is used to run the top-level coroutine and provide an event loop for `AsyncClient`, which requires one.

This code fetches data from three URLs concurrently, making it faster than fetching them one by one.

Note: Asynchronous programming is a large topic and using it effectively requires understanding async/await syntax, event loops, tasks, and more. It's a powerful tool for making efficient IO-bound programs, but for many simple scripts, synchronous programming is simpler and sufficient.

## Prompt
```
I need detailed explanation of this line.
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

Certainly, this line of code is using `asyncio.gather()`, which is a function to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently. It returns an awaitable object that yields the final results of all your input tasks.

Let's break down the line:

- `asyncio.gather(*tasks)`: This function takes a variable number of awaitables (like `fetch_data(url)` in your case) as input and returns a single awaitable that produces a list with all the results of the awaitables when they complete. This means it allows you to schedule multiple tasks at the same time and then wait for all of them to complete.

- The `*` operator is used to unpack the list of tasks. This is called argument unpacking in Python. If `tasks` is a list [task1, task2, task3], `*tasks` in a function call is equivalent to `task1, task2, task3`.

- `await asyncio.gather(*tasks)`: `await` is used to wait for the `asyncio.gather()` function to complete. In other words, it waits for all the tasks to complete and then continues execution. This means that all the tasks run concurrently and when all are finished, their results are gathered into a list. The execution will not proceed until all tasks have completed.

So, `results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)` means "run all the tasks concurrently, wait for all of them to complete, then assign the results to the variable `results`". The result will be a list of the return values of all tasks, in the order they were originally given.

## Prompt

```
thank you. What arguments gather function accepts. Why did we have to unpack the tasks list?
```

The `asyncio.gather()` function accepts any number of awaitable objects (like coroutines or Futures) as arguments and returns an awaitable Future object that aggregates results from all the given awaitable objects.

In the signature of `gather()`, it's like:

```python
gather(*awaitables, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
```

As you can see, the `*` in the function definition indicates that any number of arguments (awaitables) can be passed.

Coming to your second question: You had a list of tasks (which are all awaitable objects). When you do `asyncio.gather(*tasks)`, you're using the "splat" operator (`*`) in Python to unpack the list. This effectively turns the elements of your list into individual arguments to the `gather()` function. 

For example, if `tasks = [task1, task2, task3]`, calling `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` is equivalent to calling `asyncio.gather(task1, task2, task3)`.

So, you're unpacking the list of tasks to turn them into individual arguments to the `gather()` function because the function expects multiple awaitable objects, not a single list object.

I hope this helps clarify things! Let me know if you have more questions.
